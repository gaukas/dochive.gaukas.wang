If you are about to buy a new iPhone online or just exploring your iPhone, you may find the Model (in Settings – General – About) is pretty confusing.

For example, the Model of your iPhone 6 you are referring to could be showing **A1586**(We call it _A-Number_) or **MG472LL/A**(We call it  _SKU_). And you can click to switch between them. But, what does it mean?

## A-Number
Take my iPhone 6 as an example. According to Apple.com, the A Number of an iPhone 6 could be one of these:
| | |
| --- | --- |
| A1549 | North America (**SKU:** MG4P2LL/A*) or Verizon Locked(**SKU:** MG5X2LL/A*) |
| A1586 | Sprint Locked/Global Unlocked (**SKU:** MG6A2LL/A*) |
| A1589 | China Mobile Locked |

As you can see, each “A Number” is unnecessarily corresponding to only one version of iPhone. But they share the same “generation” (iPhone 6). They are too vague to be used to identify the tech specs, sometime.

## SKU 
The most informative parts are the head and the tail. Taking **MG472LL/A** as an example...

| First Letter | Product Type |
| :--: | :--: |
| M | Retail |
| F | Refurbished |
| N | Replacement |
| P | Personalized (engraved) |

And the tail, **LL/A**, tells us the region (discard the /A part). 

| Code | Region |

| AB | Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates | 
| B | Ireland, UK, also used for some replacement units |
