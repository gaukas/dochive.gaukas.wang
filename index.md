# DocHive

DocHive, meaning "Document Hive", is a collection of documents, tutorials, and other resources. It is maintained by [Gaukas Wang](https://gaukas.wang) as a personal knowledge base.

It was previously served as a Hexo site, but now it is migrated to Jekyll. The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/gaukas/dochive.gaukas.wang). The site is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). And also, thanks to [Just the Docs](https://just-the-docs.com/) for the theme.
